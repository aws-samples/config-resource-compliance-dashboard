# [4.0.0] - 2025-10-30
## Added
- Account names
- **Cost Contributors** tab, to find the contributors to AWS Config cost, for example the most evaluated rules, or most changing resources.
- (**Configuration Items** tab renamed to **Resource Inventory**).
- **Resource Inventory** tab, count of total resources currently in the list (after filters at the top are applied).
- **Resource Inventory** tab, graphs showing the distribution of EC2 instances across Availability Zones.


## Changed
- Lambda partitioner function: optimized Amazon Athena API calls by checking if a partition exists already before creating it.
- **Resource Inventory** tab, removed **Last Modified** column from Lambda inventory. Resource event information is accessible from **Configuration Items Events** tab.
- **Resource Inventory** tab, added filters on Lambda (runtime) and RDS (engine, engine version, certificate authority).
- **Tag Compliance** tab, moved as second tab from the left. All visuals now include all AWS Config rules whose name starts with `required-tags`, `required-tag`, `requiredtags` or `requiredtag`. The filtering is also case insensitive.
- Athena table is now case-insensitive in the `case.insensitive` property in the SerDe (Serializer/Deserializer) configuration. This configuration specifically affects how field names in the JSON data are matched to column names in the Athena table. With this new configuration, case is ignored when matching JSON field names to the expected column names.
- When deploying AWS Config rules and conformance packs across an organization, you may notice that the names often have random postfixes added to them. This is actually by design and serves several important purposes within the AWS infrastructure. The dashboard removes that part on all visuals so that all rule and conformance pack names can be correlated. For example, `my-rule-[random-text]` is displayed as `my-rule`. When AWS Config rules and conformance packs are listed on tables, both the normalized and the original name are reported, so that you have a full reference to the rule or conformance pack if you download the data of the table.
- **About** tab, new version.
- Improved installation of the dashboard resources with `cid-cmd` tool: it is not necessary anymore to download the YAML template.

## Fixed
- Tooltip texts of visuals have meaningful field names.

# [3.0.0] - 2025-03-27
## Added
- **Compliance** tab, added compliance score visuals for resources, AWS Config rules and conformance packs.
- **Configuration Item Events** tab, added **AWS Config Coverage** visuals, reorganized visuals in the tab.
- Fully automated S3 replication in case of KMS encrypted buckets, no more manual configuration needed.

## Changed
- Deployment instructions moved to the [Cloud Intelligence Dashboards Well Architected Labs](https://catalog.workshops.aws/awscid/en-US/dashboards/additional/config-resource-compliance-dashboard).
- **Configuration Items** tab, reviewed fields displayed on **RDS Inventory**, which now include Resource ID and DB Instance.
- **About** tab: added our new email address `aws-config-dashboard@amazon.com`.
- CloudWatch Logs retention period for the Lambda functions set to 14 days.

## Fixed
- **Compliance** tab, control **Current number of compliant AWS Config rules** and **Current number of non-compliant AWS Config rules**: adjusted aggregation parameter so that they report correct data.
- **Compliance** tab, visuals that compare trends of current month vs. the previous one are now color-formatted appropriately. E.g. trends of non compliant resources going up is bad, hence the dashboard will use red in case of positive number here. 
- **Tag Compliance** tab: fixed a typo on the description at the top.
- **Configuration Item Events** correctly captures all resource events in up to the previous six months.
- **Configuration Item Events** tab, **All AWS Config Events** table filtered by account ID and region selectors at the top
- Redesigned all the Athena views for accuracy and performance.
